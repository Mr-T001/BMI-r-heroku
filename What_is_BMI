#### What is BMI?
<br/>
**Body Mass Index (BMI)** is essentially a value obtained from the weight and height of a person [1].
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
#### Calculating the BMI
<br/>
BMI can be computed by dividing the person's weight (kg) by their squared height (m) as follows:
<br/>
> BMI = kg/m^2
<br/>
where *kg* represents the person's weight and *m^2* the person's squared height.
<br/>
